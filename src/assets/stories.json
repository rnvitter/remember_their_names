He had just called members of his family, explaining how happy he was. However, police claim that they had seen Ellis trying to open doors of occupied vehicles and appeared to be suffering from ‘excited delirium,’ which is family finds unlikely, based on his previous phone calls. They maintain that Ellis was not aggressive. At 11:21 PM on the corner of 96th Street South and Ainsworth Avenue South, police claim that Ellis started pounding on a Tacoma patrol car “for no apparent reason” and that when the officers got out, Ellis threw one of the officers to the ground. Then, one of the officers deployed a taser gun, striking Ellis in the chest, which is something that they left out in the initial police report. The police also placed themselves on top of Ellis. At 11:23 PM, two minutes after the encounter began, Ellis could be heard saying that he couldn’t breathe “sir,” in an attempt to be respectful to the officers. Then, the officers began to restrain Ellis with hobbles binding his legs, handcuffs on his wrists, and a “spit hood” over his mouth to prevent him from spitting or biting. Since Ellis was struggling to breathe, officers rolled him on his side and called for medical help.  Medics arrived at 11:34 PM and noted that he was deteriorating while they attempted CPR and placed a tube down his throat to help him breathe before he was pronounced dead at 12:12 AM. However, witness reports do not match up to the police statements. According to a witness, she thought that the police were having a friendly conversation before they, unprovoked, opened the car door and knocked Ellis down. They began punching him and the witness took a video of the encounter in which she is heard saying “Stop. Oh my God, stop hitting him. Just arrest him.\" The Pierce County medical examiner ruled that Ellis’ death was a homicide, resulting from hypoxia due to physical restraint. Other factors that could have contributed were high amounts of methamphetamine, body position, heart disease, and the “spit hood” used by the officers. The officers involved in Ellis’ death were initially put on administrative leave, but they returned to work after the police department ruled that there was no violation of policy. Meanwhile, Tacoma mayor Victoria Woodards is requesting at all officers involved be fired and prosecuted, so the officers have again been placed on leave. The state is conducting an independent investigation of the incident.","Manuel Ellis was a talented musician who played drums at the church up to four nights a week. He had an 11-year-old son and an 18-month-old daughter. He had struggled with addiction and mental health, but he was starting to turn his life around and living in a clean-and-sober house. Shortly before his murder, he was on the phone with his mother in which he told her “Remember I love you.” A vigil was held for Ellis in Tacoma on June 3. He was 33 years old.","https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/manuel-ellis-death-autopsy-report-tacoma-pierce-county/281-70c83fff-138a-4e85-a903-971eaedadfc7,https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article243379221.html,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/manuel-ellis-called-tacoma-police-sir-as-he-told-them-he-couldnt-breathe-new-video-shows/,https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-honor-of-manuel-ellis,https://www.change.org/p/tacoma-police-department-and-washington-state-judicial-system-justice-for-manuel-ellis","Marriya
